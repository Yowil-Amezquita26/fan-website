                <p>The name Pokémon is a syllabic abbreviation of the 
                    Japanese brand Pocket Monsters. The term "Pokémon", 
                    in addition to referring to the Pokémon franchise itself,
                     also collectively refers to the many fictional species 
                     that have made appearances in Pokémon media as of the 
                     release of the eighth generation titles Pokémon Sword 
                     and Shield. "Pokémon" is identical in the singular 
                     and plural, as is each individual species name; 
                     it is and would be grammatically correct to 
                     say "one Pokémon" and "many Pokémon", as well 
                     as "one Pikachu" and "many Pikachu".</p>
