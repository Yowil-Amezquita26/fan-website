        <h2>Hello trainer</h2>
        <p class="description">
          For decades, kids all over the world have been discovering the
          enchanting world of Pokémon. Many of those children become lifelong
          fans. Today, the Pokémon family of products includes video games, the
          Pokémon Trading Card Game (TCG), an animated series, movies, toys,
          books, and much more. Both the Pokémon video games and the Pokémon TCG
          encourage strategic thinking on top of reading and math skills.
          Pokémon also puts a strong emphasis on good sportsmanship and respect
          for other players.

        <p class="description">
          The original Pokémon is a role-playing game based around building a
          small team of monsters to battle other monsters in a quest to become
          the best. Pokémon are divided into types, such as water and fire, each
          with different strengths. Battles between them can be likened to the
          simple hand game rock-paper-scissors. For example, to gain an
          advantage over a Pokémon that cannot beat an opponent’s Charizard
          character because of a weakness to fire, a player might substitute a
          water-based Pokémon. With experience, Pokémon grow stronger, gaining
          new abilities. By defeating Gym Leaders and obtaining Gym Badges,
          trainers garner acclaim.
