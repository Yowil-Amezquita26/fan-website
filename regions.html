            <p>
                As the Pokémon franchise continues to expand, fans are introduced to 
                increasing numbers of the beloved pocket monsters across the world with 
                every new game. 
            </p>    
            <p>Collectible With countless species across and over a dozen types to log 
                in your Pokédex, it’s no surprise that different biomes and regions of 
                the Pokémon world are better suited environments 
                for the new creatures you might encounter on your journey. From tropical islands 
                to frozen northern tundras, each Pokémon region has its own Pokémon 
                League, its own gym structure, and most importantly, its own unique 
                Pokémon ecosystem.
            </p>

                Many of these eight main settings are inspired by 
                real-world locations too! Are you ready to begin your adventure to catch ’em all? 
                Then let’s dive in to the breakdown of the eight regions of Pokémon in the order 
                they were unveiled to fans.

                    <strong>Kanto</strong>

                    <p>Kanto, named after the real-world region of Japan by the same name, features a variety of cities surrounded by mountains and plains, and even features a volcano on Cinnabar Island. Every town in the Pokémon Kanto region is named in reference to a color, like Viridian City, Lavender Town, and others. Players begin their journey in the quiet Pallet Town (a reference to the blank canvas of a painting) and the starter Pokémon offered to players in a basic Poké Ball are Squirtle, Charmander, and Bulbasaur.</p>

                    <strong>Johto</strong>
                    <p>Much of the overall aesthetic and inspiration for the Johto region comes from traditional Japanese architecture and culture, and the fictional area is inspired by the Kansai region of Japan, which includes Osaka, Kyoto, and Nara. The Kansai region has rich soils, which inspired the berry crop mechanic introduced in this generation of games.</p>
