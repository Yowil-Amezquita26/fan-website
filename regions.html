            <h2>Regions</h2>
            As the Pokémon franchise continues to expand, fans are introduced to 
            increasing numbers of the beloved pocket monsters across the world with 
            every new game. </p>
            <p> Collectible With countless species across 
            and over a dozen types to log in your Pokédex, it’s no surprise that 
            different biomes and regions of the Pokémon world are better suited environments 
            for the new creatures you might encounter on your journey. From tropical islands 
            to frozen northern tundras, each Pokémon region has its own Pokémon 
            League, its own gym structure, and most importantly, its own unique 
            Pokémon ecosystem.</p>
            <p> Many of these eight main settings are inspired by 
            real-world locations too! Are you ready to begin your adventure to catch ’em all? 
            Then let’s dive in to the breakdown of the eight regions of Pokémon in the order 
            they were unveiled to fans.</p>
